# STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION-WEB-PAGE-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS
This project aims to develop a web application that predicts stock prices using various machine learning algorithms. The primary focus is to calculate the closing prices of stocks for different companies by leveraging the following algorithms:

-**Linear Regression
-**Random Forest Regressor
-**Decision Tree Regressor
-**KNN Regressor
*The model with the highest prediction accuracy is deployed for web access using Streamlit, providing actionable insights.

##Features
* Predicts stock prices based on historical data
* Compares multiple machine learning models to determine the best fit
* User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit
* 
##Technologies Used
-**Python
-**Machine Learning Algorithms
-**Streamlit
-**Yahoo Finance (for dataset collection)
